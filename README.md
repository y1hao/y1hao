### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

Welcome to my GitHub account. I'm Yihao. I currently work as a software engineer.

Occasionaly, I write my thoughts on programming in this repo: [y1hao/comments](https://github.com/y1hao/comments).

Here are some small but fun projects I built in the past:

- [Octostache Playground](https://github.com/y1hao/octostache-playground)
  A live playground to try out [Octostache](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Octostache) syntax. It ports the C# library into WebAssembly and runs directly in browser.
  
- [Rain](https://github.com/y1hao/Rain)
  A visualization of development velocity of some popular open source repositories.

- [Gomoku](https://github.com/y1hao/gomoku)
  A real-time multi-player console Gomoku game written in Go.

- [Game of Life Go](https://github.com/y1hao/game-of-life-go)
  A two-player version of Conway's Game of Life.

- [yBlog](https://github.com/y1hao/yBlog)
  A Hugo theme for writing blogs. (It looks really nice and I quite enjoy creating it. But after that it turned out I never actually used it to write blogs. Instead now I simply use a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/y1hao/comments) for writing some posts with README files. I wrote Python scripts to synchonize all the links and tags etc).

- [The Most Dangerous Writing App VSCode Extension](https://github.com/y1hao/the-most-dangerous-writing-app-extension)
  Run [the most dangerous writing app](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app) in VSCode.

- [Git Clock](https://github.com/y1hao/gitclock)
  What is your Git clock type?

- [Colorful Life](https://github.com/y1hao/ColorfulLife)
  A colorful, configurable version of Conway's Game of Life.

- [Div](https://github.com/y1hao/Div) Turns HTML into a functional programming language.
